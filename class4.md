# Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links ” :
- Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another .
-Links are created using the a element. Users can click on anything between the opening a tag and the closing 
  a tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
  -  URL (or Uniform Resource Locator) is made up of the domain name followed by the path to that page or image.
- Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

- mailto:<br> To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address.
- You can create links to open email programs with an  email address in the "to" field

- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
# Chapter 15: “Layout” :
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
- Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include: h1, p ,ul ,li .
- inline elements flow in Between surrounding text Examples include: img, b ,i .


- div  elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
-  positioning schemes : that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning
  - The   float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
  - z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top.

  - Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
-  Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
- Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch .
  - Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

  - Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
 - CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks .
 - You can include multiple CSS files in one page by using' @'import .
 # JS BOOK Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects ” :
 - Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. 
 - OBJECTS :create models of the world using data.
 - to declare function we give it a name , the return value could br single or multi .
 - Expressions produce a value
- *IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS*
- This way of writing a function is used in several different situations. Often functions are used to ensure that the variable names do not conflict with each other.
- WHEN TO USE ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS AND llFES :
- **As an argument when a function is called (to calculate a value for that function).** 
• To assign the value of a property to an object. 
• In event handlers and listeners to perform a task when an event occurs. 
• To prevent conflicts between two scripts that might use the same variable names 
- The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is known as the variable's scope. 
- Global variables use more memory .
