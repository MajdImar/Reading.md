# Summary Html :
- **Introduction** :
1. The book has three parts:
-  HtML :is used to create web pages.
- css : enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages.
2.Different ways in which people access the web and clarify some terminology:
- Browsers :People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.
- weB servers : Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them.
- DevIces: including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- Screen readers : are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. They are commonly used by people with visual impairments.
3. How weBsItes are created :
- All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.
-  more complex sites  may use a database to store data, and programming languages such as PHP, ASP.Net, Java, or Ruby on the web server.
4. How the web works:
- The web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
- steps:
1.When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
2.Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) server.
3.The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.
4.The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
- **web server** : is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.
- **chapter1 Structure** :
* HtmL deScribeS tHe Structure of PageS :HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
* Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
* attributeS teLL uS more about eLementS :name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
* Anything written between the <title> tags will appear in the title bar (or tabs) at the top of the browser window.
  - **chapter8 Extra Markup** :
  - thE Evolution of htMl :
  (htMl 4 rElEasEd 1997, xhtMl 1.0 rElEasEd 2000,htMl5 rElEasEd 2000)
  - DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using .
- You can add comments to your code between <!-- and -->  markers  .
  - The  id and class attributes allow you to identify the particular elements,s known as a **global attribute** because it can be used on any element . 
  - Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
  
  - Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.

- span :
1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text
2. Contain a number of inline elements

- The  div and span elements allow you to group blocklevel and inline elements together.
- iframes : cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- There are a few attributes that you will need to know to use it:
(src,height,width)
- scrolling ,frameborder :attributes will not be supported in HTML5.
- seamless :in HTML5, a new attribute called seamless can be applied to an iframe where scrollbars are not desired. 
The meta element is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag. It uses attributes to carry the information.
- The   meta tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special  characters in your pages .
- **chapter17 HTML5 Layout** :
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describeits structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple div elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5  elements need to be told which elements areblock-level elements.
- hgroup:The purpose of the hgroup element is to group together a set of one or more h1 through h6 elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
  - Figures : It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images). 
  - The figure element should also contain a <figcaption> element which provides a text decription for the content of the figure element. 
  - The aside element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an article element or not.
1. When the aside element is used inside an article element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. 
  2. When the <aside> element is used outside of an article element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
- **chapter18 Process & Design** :
