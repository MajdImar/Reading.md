# HTML BOOK Chapter 2 **Text** :
- When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page.
- These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.
- uses of some tags :
* b --- Bold    
* i ---italic
* sup -- o contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates oa power such as 2<sup> 2 </sup>. 
* sub -- the number apeear down co <sub> 2 </sub> .
* br / -- add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph .
* hr / -- we put just one tag without closing tag and without adding anyhting inside it ,just put it between paraghraphs to  create a break between themes .
* strong -- indicates that its content has strong importance
* em -- indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.
* blockquote --t is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph .
*  q -- used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph .
* abbr or acronym -- abbreviation or an acronym book ex p 53
* cite --  where the citation is from.
* dfn -- element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term.
* address --to contain contact details for the author of the page.

* ## empty elements :  elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag .
- # Visual ediTors & THeir code VieWs :
1. Visual editors often resemble word processors. 
2. Code views show you the code created by the visual editor .
- ## semanTic markuP :  some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages .
- ##  provide semantic information (e.g. where  emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
  # chapter 10 **Introducing CSS** :
  - CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
  - Rules are made up of selectors &  declarations  .
  1. selectors: that specify the   elements the rule applies toand. 
  2. declarations that indicate what these elements should look like.
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your   rules at different elements.
- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value.
1. Properties : indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. 
2. Values : specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties .
- we can use the externar or InternaL or inline in the css.
- cSS SeLectorS :llow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
 # **JS book** chapter2 **Basic JavaScript Instructions** :
 -  A script is made up of a series of statements, Each individual instruction or step is known as a statemen.
 - Scripts contain very precise instructions.
 - Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. 
 - Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 
 - This technique for creating an array is known as an array litera.
 - Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index
 - JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
 - Expressions evaluate into a single value.
 1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE .
 2.EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE . 
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 
- There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 
# chapter4 **Decisions and Loop** :
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- operators :
1. logical operators
2. comparison operators
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)  .
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- 1.If statement it evaluates a condition, if the condition evaluates to true, any statement in the subsequent code block will be executed.
2. IF Else Statements
