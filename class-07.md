# Article:Domain Modeling

* **Domain modeling :is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.**

Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
# Chapter 6: “Tables” :
- table element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the tr element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells  represented by the td element (or th if it is a header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row  or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes. 
- For long tables you can split the table into a thead, tbody, and tfoot.
#  From  Js book “Functions, Methods, and Objects” :
- yoo can create ,update and delete an object .
- The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means.
- To organize your data , you can use an array or object to group a set of related values.
* In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key. 
- we can put arrays inside objects and objects inside arrays.
- Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window.
1. BROWSER OBJECT MODEL 
The Browser Object Model contains objects that represent the current browser window or tab
2. DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL :
The Document Object Model uses objects to create a representation of the current page
3. GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS :
The global JavaScript objects represent things that the JavaScript language needs to create a model of.
-GLOBAL OBJECTS: STRING OBJECT 
- Each character in a string is automatically given a number, called an index number.
- In JavaScript there are six data types: Five of them are described as simple (or primitive) data types. The sixth is the object (and is referred to as a complex data type). 
- NUMBER OBJECT:
* (isNaN,toFixed,toPrecision,toExponential )
