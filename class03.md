# Chapter 3: “Lists” :
1. There are 3 types of lists :
- Ordered lists ol tag
- Unordered lists  ul tag
- Definition lists: consists of a series of terms and their definitions with dl tag, <br>  dt contain the term being defined , <br> dd This is used to contain the definition .
- **NESTED Lists** :You can put a second list inside an li element to create a sublist or nested list.
- Ordered lists use numbers .
- Unordered lists use bullets .
# Chapter 13: “Boxes” :
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box .
1. min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow.
2.  the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.
- overflow :tells the browser what to do if the content contained within <b> a box is larger than the box itself with 2 values : 1.hidden This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.2.scroll This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.



- It is possible to hide elements using the display and  visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of  boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.
- The border-image property applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a background image and slices it into nine pieces.
- This property requires three pieces of information:
1: The URL of the image 2: Where to slice the image 3: What to do with the straight edges; the possible values are: stretch stretches the image repeat repeats the image round like repeat but if the  tiles do not fit exactly, scales  the tile image so they will .
- The box-shadow property allows you to add a drop shadow around a box.
# Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” :
- **SWITCH STATEMENTS** :
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
- **TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING** :If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sense of the operation rather than report an error.  
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
1. weak typing 
2. strong typing. 
- *NaN is a value that is counted as a number. You may see it when a number is expected, but is not returned, e.g .. ('ten' /2) results in NaN* .
- Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or fa 1 se). 
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements. 
- A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array. 
- The key difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1e  loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition.
