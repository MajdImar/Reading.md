# Chapter 15: “Layout” :
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
- Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include: h1, p ,ul ,li .
- inline elements flow in Between surrounding text Examples include: img, b ,i .


- div  elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
-  positioning schemes : that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning
  - The   float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
  - z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top.

  - Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
-  Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
- Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch .
  - Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

  - Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
 - CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks .
 - You can include multiple CSS files in one page by using' @'import .
