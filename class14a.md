# CSS Transforms:
- Transforms <br>
<p>With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.</p>
- The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional.<br>
- CSS Transitions & Animations:<br>
- With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.<br>

-Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes.
**ransitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes**
