# THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS :
 <P> The localStorage and sessionStorage properties allow to save key/value pairs in a web browser. The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year. The localStorage property is read-only </P>
 - From your JavaScript code, you’ll access HTML5 Storage through the localStorage object on the global window object. Before you can use it, you should.
 - While the past is littered with hacks and workarounds, the present condition of HTML5 Storage is surprisingly rosy. A new API has been standardized and implemented across all major browsers, platforms, and devices. As a web developer, that’s just not something you see every day, is it? But there is more to life than “5 megabytes of named key/value pairs,” and the future of persistent local storage is… how shall I put it… well, there are competing visions.

- One vision is an acronym that you probably know already: SQL. In 2007, Google launched Gears, an open source cross-browser plugin which included an embedded database based on SQLite. This early prototype later influenced the creation of the Web SQL Database specification. Web SQL Database (formerly known as “WebDB”) provides a thin wrapper around a SQL database, allowing you to do things like this from JavaScripT .
